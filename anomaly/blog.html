        <p>I had the <span class="redacted">same dream</span> again. This time, before I slipped under, they all turned to look at me. Jesus fuck. the sound... I can still hear it, just this wave of static and screaming and?? weirdly enough, dial-up noises.</p>

        <p>Okay maybe I should explain what that all was before jumping into it like that. I’ve been having these weird dreams sometimes. They’re not nightmares… but they’re creepy as shit. Ever since we took off and explored that old mental hospital like two hours away. Figured it’d be best to just. Write everything down. So someone maybe knows I’m not going crazy. Or is at least around to witness it. as for the title... I dunno, it's definitely not normal... and I sure am encountering it</p>

        <p class="bottommost">I don’t remember how I made it to the room—I was just <strong>there</strong>. standing, floating, almost, in a puddle that was so still it reflected everything, except for me. there was no light, but it reflected everything just the same. and there was a chorus. a digital mass, like, a church service. well. it was a mass, too, there were nine of them. all looking up towards the sky with their mouths open, screaming, so loud it actually made it feel like my head was about to explode. they were chanting something I couldn't understand, even in the dream. they were all wired together. feeding off one another, I guess? and then I was falling, slipping through the water. and then I woke up</p>
