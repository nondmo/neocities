    <h4>projects</h4>
    <h5>february 16 2025</h5>
    <p>adding a resources section under my interests&mdash;I have a few projects I've kept on the backburner for a while & maybe I should actually get around to. you know. working on them. I really need stuff I can chew on, and I do need to be gentler with myself in realizing that these things do take time. it takes more than a single instant to make something worthwhile, especially if it's going to have any significant weight to it. I'd also like to have some actual stuff to put on my itch.io?? still need to work on making that look nice, but maybe I will after it has some meat. for now: writing, making zines, learning to code in some real capacity. not that all of this (gestures widely) isn't coding, but my skills are significantly limited by being so hesitant to pick up javascript.</p>
    <hr style="width: 75%; border: 1px dotted #444444;">

    <h4>some progress?</h4>
    <h5>february 15 2025</h5>
    <p>might start offering tarot readings (choose between 1-3 cards or a more personalized spread) on my ko-fi, which I remembered existed and haven't touched in at least three years. I'm really enjoying doing readings&mdash;been doing them for friends here and there so some success so I may as well open it up. just need to get some pics together for the listings (I will do this <em>eventually</em> I swear) and actually list them in my shop, then it's golden. anyway. it all goes towards 1&rpar; a new car and 2&rpar; paying down some debts. will definitely update this site once they're ready. and honestly, I think I may need to move my social links into the footer instead of having them up top. such is the nature of an evolving website!! and having total control of it &lt;3</p>
    <hr style="width: 75%; border: 1px dotted #444444;">

    <h4>thinking of things.</h4>
    <h5>february 14 2025</h5>
    <p>added a few pages: <a href="./tarot.html">tarot readings</a> and <a href="./work.html">collected works</a> as I aim to embrace my more creative tendencies and actually work on making zines/prints/what-have-you. <a href="http://lichensonline.neocities.org">a friend of mine</a> passed on a small-vendor market that I'm aiming to table at this year, fingers crossed! very poetic, for me in particular&mdash;I remember getting the chance to table at a con years back and pulled out at the last moment because I felt just so much pressure to write, bind the actual book, the whole thing. but I think now that I've dabbled in smaller-stakes publishing (or at least spent some *actual* time learning about it instead of assuming the Traditional way to do things was the only way) I feel much more ready to take it on. I'm also on a tear at the moment to build up an actual savings and fund a long sabbatical. I know it's not ideal but I feel like I am truly burning myself out at every turn and don't know what else to do. but for now. I have stability and if I can make it work ie. distancing myself from being so damn emotional about work itself, then it'll be an easier transition to whatever else comes down the line.</p>
    <hr style="width: 75%; border: 1px dotted #444444;">

    <h4>reflections & some venting</h4>
    <h5>February 12 2025</h5>
    <p>so you might notice that the site looks a little different...... I wanted to have a larger text area & a bit more space to play, I guess, with navigtation and etc. I also I wanted a bit more of a cohesive/one-column deal which I'm liking quite a bit! monochrome-ish, pretty standard, kinda plain with some cryptic/non-alphabet text sprinkled in. I like it.<br/>
    on top of everything else happening, I just got back from a week in London and I've felt the most profound sense of unease. like, I've been weeping at the slightest provocation and utterly tired. don't know what I'm going to do about it. there's a weird tightness&mdash;maybe hollowness is a better term&mdash;in my chest that I can't seem to get rid of.<br/>
anyway. more substack stuff coming soon. planning to dabble in making and distributing zines. slowly but surely. as it goes.</p>
    <hr style="width: 75%; border: 1px dotted #444444;">

    <h4>mobile updates & improv shows</h4>
    <h5>January 27 2025</h5>
    <p>okay first things first... dropout improv whipped so much ass. I was genuinely laughing from the time the show
      started until well after its end. I <em>wish</em> I could describe its funniest bits but there are just so many. and
      honestly? it was great to see some of my favorite comedians in real life. <br />
      in other news: I've started packing for my trip and I've gotten a friend into neocities! perhaps flirting with the
      idea of starting a webring, suggested by another friend, but we wouldn't know what to call it. no rush, I suppose.
      <br />
      oh yeah&mdash;the changes to the site. there's a mobile site, now, considering I keep an nfc tag in my locket that
      directs people to here. would be nice if they could actually read the site. if you're curious, or just want to browse,
      <a href="/mobile">here's the link</a>. be warned: it looks like ass on desktop. I'm toying around with a different
      color scheme, though I think I may just paletteswap it with the one I use here. and uh. I guess that's it! working
      happily on my writing, genuinely hoping that someday, in time, it'll be a real thing. a paid thing. a job thing.
      career? it feels weird to think of it that way. I just want to make my art and survive instead of putting so much
      brainpower towards the paycheck-thing so that I can do the worthwhile-thing. there's a substack post in here
      somewhere, I can feel it
    </p>
    <hr style="width: 75%; border: 1px dotted #444444;">


    <h4>wips & working my creative writing muscles</h4>
    <h5>January 21 2025</h5>
    <p>removed links to <em>encountering the anomaly</em> for now&mdash;I want to rework it and make it more of a true supplement to the story I'm working on. eventually it'll become a novella-size, arg-style thing that you can browse alongside the story. published somewhere. I really don't know! having this site has really gotten me thinking about how to make more multimedia art & I'm really not upset about it. god, I missed old web design so much and I didn't even realize it slipped away so quickly in favor of sleek, same-y websites.
    </p>
    <hr style="width: 75%; border: 1px dotted #444444;">

    <h4>art curation & more</h4>
    <h5>January 20 2025</h5>
    <p>added a new page! a while back I saw a street interview where a woman was asked what she'd do as a dream career; she said she had the degrees to become a museum curator but not the experience. the interviewer asked why she hadn't given herself the permission to do it: started her own newsletter or website where she did just that. pull-yourself-up-by-your-bootstraps attitude aside, it stuck with me. I've been thinking about different ways to do it, either through substack or a tumblr blog but I think placing it here is just fine, too. it's more... mine, I suppose, that way. I made the website, I curate <a href="curated.html">the exhibit</a>, and you're welcome to browse. :)<br/>in more personal updates, I had lunch and coffee with a friend who I hadn't seen in too long, and had a delicious cauliflower-garlic-cheddar soup for dinner with sourdough croutons. I'm starting to sketch architectural studies of buildings I find interesting. I dunno&mdash;being off tiktok and social media in general has really helped with me being more creative. it feels nice. like a return to my true self. much to unpack there.
    </p>
    <hr style="width: 75%; border: 1px dotted #444444;">

    <h4>a third week of self-guided study</h4>
    <h5>January 19 2025</h5>
    <p>been trying to beat back the ~sunday scaries~ with sessions of self-guided study where I go to a large library (bpl) and browse the stacks, picking out something I like and just flipping through. learned about the nettime collective, and how it was one of the defining things for early web & digital art in the 90s.<br/>also looked through two books of Nam June Paik's work, which I've always been enamored with! I love digital sculpture so much. it was so nice to take my time with it & think about the process behind the pieces, especially some of the installations he's done.<br/>and finally - I'm learning to use scrivener at its full potential! the corkboard feature is honestly so powerful & I can't believe I ignored it in favor of keeping notes on the chapters themselves. learning to work in a nonlinear fashion for writing fiction (outlining & writing as I please) has been a real game changer.
    </p>
    <hr style="width: 75%; border: 1px dotted #444444;">

    <h4>oh to be at the family pc again</h4>
    <h5>January 18 2025</h5>
    <p>lots of little additions to the site! status box, the blinkie collection (it will grow), and links for a webring (ghostring) app. also: working on a creative writing project I've had kicking around for a couple months. <br/>it'll definitely be a published thing at some point, the web project is more of a supplemental and an exercise in doing mixed media/ARG-type extra content.
    </p>
    <hr style="width: 75%; border: 1px dotted #444444;">

<h4>just had the best banh mi of my life ngl</h4>
<h5>January 17 2025</h5>
<p>pro tip, throw your delivery meal in the toaster oven when it gets to your place. warms it up and makes it all toasty. not really thinking about doing much tonight but tomorrow I'll prob be out most of the day just to give myself a change of scenery & write somewhere that's not my apartment. on that front: glad I started listening to the magnus archives. still workshopping a few things. but it's going well. it's all coming together :)
</p>
<hr style="width: 75%; border: 1px dotted #444444;">

<h4>okay I think I'm getting the hang of the webdev process</h4>
<h5>January 16 2025</h5>
<p>New layout & some widgets! Liking the overall look of things, it's mine and not based on any one template (def inspired by a few other sites I've seen though) and I'm super proud of it so far. (✿◡‿◡) I should definitely switch things over to a private repository. I know everyone's going to be able to see this anyway, but it might be better just in practice. Also tried my hand at an Idle Game Maker game&mdash;a simple one, just to fuck around with it. Based on the Discord bot Mudae's kakera (point) system, to honor the patron gods that have gained some notoriety among us.</p>
<hr style="width: 75%; border: 1px dotted #444444;">

  <h4>does the ruby gem work</h4>
  <h5>January 15 2025</h5>
  <p><em>If you're seeing this, then the ruby gem works! No idea what went wrong with the Github action.</em><br/>In other news, the Discord server's JPEG trading card game has developed a pantheon. May The Giant Rat Who Makes All of the Rules, Monkey Blue, and Uta bless our rolls.</p>
  <hr style="width: 75%; border: 1px dotted #444444;">

<h4>genuinely lucky</h4>
<h5>January 14 2025</h5>
<p>That's all.<br/><em>Aside: damn, Neocities whips. This shit is fun as hell.</em>
</p>
<hr style="width: 75%; border: 1px dotted #444444;">

<h4>great googly moogly it's all gone to shit</h4>
<h5>January 13 2025</h5>
<p>Hey so does anyone know why we're working so hard? Like genuinely, what are we doing all of this for? 
</p>
<hr style="width: 75%; border: 1px dotted #444444;">

<h4>The Cream of the Crop</h4>
<h5>January 11 2025</h5>
<p>The cream rises to the top. Waiting on a delivery, attending a belated Christmas party.</p>
<hr style="width: 75%; border: 1px dotted #444444;">

<h4>The Taco Bell Tolls For Thee</h4>
<h5>January 10 2025</h5>
<p>None of the Taco Bells around me will deliver, and I can't order the nuggets from the ones that <em>do</em> deliver.</p>
<hr style="width: 75%; border: 1px dotted #444444;">

<h4>Site Update: Theme & Blog</h4>
<h5>January 9 2025</h5>
<p><em>Finally</em> got around to setting up this page! Figured it may be nice to have an old-school blog that's a bit more lowkey than a Substack post. And, frankly, I'm enamored with the ways that the old internet (per se) is creeping back into the mainstream. Delightful to see&mdash;excited to be a part of it.</p>
