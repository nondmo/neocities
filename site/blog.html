    <h4>a third week of self-guided study</h4>
    <h5>January 19 2025</h5>
    <p>been trying to beat back the ~sunday scaries~ with sessions of self-guided study where I go to a large library (bpl) and browse the stacks, picking out something I like and just flipping through. learned about the nettime collective, and how it was one of the defining things for early web & digital art in the 90s.<br/>also looked through two books of Nam June Paik's work, which I've always been enamored with! I love digital sculpture so much. it was so nice to take my time with it & think about the process behind the pieces, especially some of the installations he's done.<br/>and finally - I'm learning to use scrivener at its full potential! the corkboard feature is honestly so powerful & I can't believe I ignored it in favor of keeping notes on the chapters themselves. learning to work in a nonlinear fashion for writing fiction (outlining & writing as I please) has been a real game changer.

    <h4>oh to be at the family pc again</h4>
    <h5>January 18 2025</h5>
    <p>lots of little additions to the site! status box, the blinkie collection (it will grow), and links for a webring (ghostring) app. also: working on a creative writing project I've had kicking around for a couple months. <br/>it'll definitely be a published thing at some point, the web project is more of a supplemental and an exercise in doing mixed media/ARG-type extra content.

<h4>just had the best banh mi of my life ngl</h4>
<h5>January 17 2025</h5>
<p>pro tip, throw your delivery meal in the toaster oven when it gets to your place. warms it up and makes it all toasty. not really thinking about doing much tonight but tomorrow I'll prob be out most of the day just to give myself a change of scenery & write somewhere that's not my apartment. on that front: glad I started listening to the magnus archives. still workshopping a few things. but it's going well. it's all coming together :)

<h4>okay I think I'm getting the hang of the webdev process</h4>
<h5>January 16 2025</h5>
<p>New layout & some widgets! Liking the overall look of things, it's mine and not based on any one template (def inspired by a few other sites I've seen though) and I'm super proud of it so far. (✿◡‿◡) I should definitely switch things over to a private repository. I know everyone's going to be able to see this anyway, but it might be better just in practice. Also tried my hand at an Idle Game Maker game&mdash;a simple one, just to fuck around with it. Based on the Discord bot Mudae's kakera (point) system, to honor the patron gods that have gained some notoriety among us.</p>

  <h4>does the ruby gem work</h4>
  <h5>January 15 2025</h5>
  <p><em>If you're seeing this, then the ruby gem works! No idea what went wrong with the Github action.</em><br/>In other news, the Discord server's JPEG trading card game has developed a pantheon. May The Giant Rat Who Makes All of the Rules, Monkey Blue, and Uta bless our rolls.</p>

<h4>genuinely lucky</h4>
<h5>January 14 2025</h5>
<p>That's all.<br/><em>Aside: damn, Neocities whips. This shit is fun as hell.</em>

<h4>great googly moogly it's all gone to shit</h4>
<h5>January 13 2025</h5>
<p>Hey so does anyone know why we're working so hard? Like genuinely, what are we doing all of this for?

<h4>The Cream of the Crop</h4>
<h5>January 11 2025</h5>
<p>The cream rises to the top. Waiting on a delivery, attending a belated Christmas party.</p>

<h4>The Taco Bell Tolls For Thee</h4>
<h5>January 10 2025</h5>
<p>None of the Taco Bells around me will deliver, and I can't order the nuggets from the ones that <em>do</em> deliver.</p>

<h4>Site Update: Theme & Blog</h4>
<h5>January 9 2025</h5>
<p><em>Finally</em> got around to setting up this page! Figured it may be nice to have an old-school blog that's a bit more lowkey than a Substack post. And, frankly, I'm enamored with the ways that the old internet (per se) is creeping back into the mainstream. Delightful to see&mdash;excited to be a part of it.</p>
